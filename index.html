        <p>This is one of the many projects I'm working on. This is one of the biggest ones because the idea of my own website is crazy! But with this. Knowing CSS and HTML is needed. This is the best example of each of those. I'm proud to show my work to the world. But I still have other projects to talk about.</p>

        <p>Currently, my google extension is being reviewed. But it meant more for school wise but still a great thing to learn. It still uses HTML and CSS but I had to use some JS(Javascript) to make the dark mode. And I used JSON files to make the registry to it. This was one of my favorite things to do but it just takes so much time to publish. I wish I could make more for the store but the time is a long time to make.</p>

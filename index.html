        <p>This is one of the many projects I'm working on. This is one of the biggest ones because the idea of my own website is crazy! But with this. Knowing CSS and HTML is needed. This is the best example of each of those. I'm proud to show my work to the world. But I still have other projects to talk about.</p>

        <p>Currently, my google extension is being reviewed. But it meant more for school wise but still a great thing to learn. It still uses HTML and CSS but I had to use some JS(Javascript) to make the dark mode. And I used JSON files to make the registry to it. This was one of my favorite things to do but it just takes so much time to publish. I wish I could make more for the store but the time is a long time to make.</p>

        <p>Learning to make phone apps was the worse. I had to learn Java and that is its own mess. But time put in it was great. But there is no way to get really advance without thousands of hours of work. But the ones I made would never be released to the public for a while. It cost around $25 to make a google play appliance. And getting that money isn't easy for someone like me. You can support me with application use or donations. But that not what we are here for. The creation isn't meant for beginners and not really for anyone.</p>

        <p>I love supporting other creations but I have my own projects to fund. If you care to fund my work. Email me at korgug@gmail.com or tweet at me at @Galaxy_jpg. If you want to fix my work. That works too. Check out my github and suggest fixes.</p>

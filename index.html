        <p>This is one of the many projects I'm working on. This is one of the biggest ones because the idea of my own website is crazy! But with this. Knowing CSS and HTML is needed. This is the best example of each of those. I'm proud to show my work to the world. But I still have other projects to talk about.</p>

        <p>Currently, I have one google extension up and loaded. It's meant more for a school-wise but doesn't really matter. I will be hopefully making more shortly. Just need some extra time on my hands.</p>

        <p>Learning to make phone apps was the worse. I had to learn Java and that is its own mess. But time put in it was great. But there is no way to get really advance without thousands of hours of work. But the ones I made would never be released to the public for a while. It cost around $25 to make a google play appliance. And getting that money isn't easy for someone like me. You can support me with application use or donations. But that not what we are here for. The creation isn't meant for beginners and not really for anyone.</p>

        <center><h2 class="support-header">Support</h2></center>
        <p>I love supporting other creations but I have my own projects to fund. If you care to fund my work. Email me at korgug@gmail.com or tweet at me at @Galaxy_jpg. If you want to fix my work. That works too. Check out my Github and suggest fixes.</p>
